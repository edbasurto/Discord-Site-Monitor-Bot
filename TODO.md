# Ideas
If site is down, have the bot send a message every so often that the site is down until 

Have separate list of sites that are down

# Commands
-status : bot replies with the status of all site pings
-down : bot replies with all sites that are down
-help : bot replies with all commands that can be used
-ignore [site] [time] : ignores certain site name or ip address for x amount of time in seconds
-add [site] [ip] : adds site with ip to json file, might need to have a function that checks ip address
-remove [site] or [ip] : removes site and sites ip from json file
